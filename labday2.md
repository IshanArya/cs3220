Lab day #2 Assignments 

(Due : 2/3/21)



In this assignments, you will advance your verilog knowledge.  

Please checkout labday2_files folder from the github. 

Before you start lab2, please complete lab1 and watch  verilog_part2.mp4 videos.  

**What to submit**: a screenshot of final simulation. 

**Grading**: Submit a screenshot of the last tasks that you have completed. 

We won't grade the correctness of tasks. However, we strongly encourage you to complete tasks and ask TAs/instructors during the lab day lecture hours if you face any problems.  

These labday tasks are designed to help your assignment #2. 

 

**Task #1**: create a project with bus_example. 

Draw a bus design diagram based on bus_sigs module. 
The correct answer is bus_design.jpg (which is also shown below)

![bus diagram](bus_design.jpg "bus diagram")

Test module has 
``` {in_3, in_2, in_1} = i[8:0];```
Answer what this statement is doing.  

(you don't need to submit the answer)

The solution diagram is in the folder. 



**Task #2**: Extend D-flop with enable and clear signal  (dflop example folder)

Frame and testing code examples are provided. 



**Task #3**: [Optional] Complete the state machine.  (state_example folder)

Please complete the module to have a following state diagram 

![plot](state_diagram_converted.png "state diagram")



A Frame and testing code are provided. 

An example code is in verilog_part2.pptx



**Task #4**:  Initialize the memory with test.mem (mem_example folder)

First, initialize the memory contents using ex1.mem file. 

Read the value from the memory every cycle and write a new contents (old content + 1) to the same memory location. 

Every cycle, the memory address is incremented.  

In this design, you are using synchronous design. 





An example code is in verilog_part2.pptx 

Note: The example verilog codes are mostly from "Verilog by example: a concise introduction for FPGA design" by Blaine C. Readler"
