# CS 3220 Spring 2021 Syllabus



**Course Title: CS3220**

**Instructor: Prof. Hyesoon Kim**

**Class location: Bluejeans**

**Class time: M/W 2:00 PM - 3:15 PM EST** 

**Instructor's Office hours:** **W 3:15 - 3:30 pm or by appointment  at MS Team** 

**TAs**: Sam Jijina  (mailto:sam.jijina@gatech.edu) and Hanning Chen (mailto:hanningchen97@gatech.edu)

**Note about TA office hours**: We cannot hold "a regular Bluejeans office hour" as student teams will not be able to share their screen (containing their code) with the TA if multiple teams are in a single video call. Hence, each TA will be using a sign up sheet for their office hours. **The sign up sheet will be shared in the class Piazza**.

Please use the aforementioned sheet and put your team's bluejeans call link into the sheet. The TA will then join your Bluejeans meeting. **Since we are using this approach each slot in the sign up sheet will be 10 minutes so that we can maximixe the number of teams we can help in one office hour session**.

**TA's office hours (please also read the note above):**

* Sam Jijina : ***Every Wednesday 11am to 12pm EST***

* Hanning Chen : ***Every Thursday 3pm to 4pm EST***

**TA's office location:** Bluejeans + sign up sheet (instructions above)

**Class homepage**: https://gt-cs3220-spr21.github.io/

**Online platforms for resource**: We will use **Canvas** for assignment submissions and lecture note distributions. We will also use **Piazza** for discussions. 


In this course, we will study hardware implementation of architecture design. This is an intermediate-level course that follows CS2200. This course is a project-based course in which you will learn pipelined architectures by actually implementing simple instructions using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) board. 

**Course Description**

 The course will strengthen the background knowledge of processor design by understanding timing issues, critical path, and other underlying hardware structures. It will also provide an understanding of architecture, system, assembly programming and increase programming and debugging skills. 

 

**Topics:**

- FPGA programming, hardware description language (verilog)

- FPGA testing 

- Digital design 

- Pipeline design 

-  Processor architecture 

- High-speed arithmetic

- Modern processors

- FPGA programming with High-level synthesis

- Accelerators for emerging workloads

- Pynq Boards 

- Xilinix tool chains 

  

 

**Pre-requisite**: 

CS2200 and ECE 2031

 

Textbooks: There is no required textbook for the course

FPGA boards: In this semester we don't ask students to purchase boards and students will remotely conntect FPGA boards 

 

**Grading Scheme** 

**(Option #1)**

   Project assignment 1: 5 

   Project assignment 2: 10  

   Project assignment 3: 40

   Project assignment 4: 10 

   Project assignment 5: 10

   Lab day assignments : 5 

   Final exam: 15

   Class participation:  5 

 

**Option #2: Research track** 

Projects #1-#3, part-2  are the same as option #1. 

Project #3 part-3, Project #4, Project #5 and Final exam can be substituted with a research project. 

The research project topics will be announced in the later semester. 

 

 

**Final grade algorithm** 

90 <=  score <= 100 : A 
80 <=   score < 90:  B 
70 <=   score < 80:  C 
60 <=   score < 70:  D 
  score < 60:  F 


A few notes: 

I plan to use non-curved grade assignment unless there are too few As. 

 

**FPGA boards & Programming Platforms**: We will use Xilinix Pynq boards for the class. Students will use VM  system to log in remotely. For some assignments, the students will access the boards remotely. 



**Assignments:** Most of the assignments are 2-student projects.  However, each student should submit his/her own report written by individuals. The report collaboration with other students other than the project partner is prohibited but discussions with other students are encouraged. Submitting any work other than you and your partner's own is a violating of the Academic Honor Code. If you are not sure what you can discuss or not, please contact the instructor. 

**1-member team policy**: Most of the projects are 2-team member projects. A 1-member team can be approved by the instructor for some specific cases.  Please discuss with the instructor for the details. 



**Assignment late policy:** All assignments are due on the day specified by the assignment description and posted online. No late submissions are allowed except for the approval from the dean of students. 

Assignment submission rules: You must follow the submission guidelines specified in the assignment description. We will use Canvas. Wrong file names, broken file formats, missing files will lose 5% of the grade. 

**Regrades:** Regrades are obtained by submitting a written explanation to the instructor within a week of when the work was returned in class. Regrades will only be discussed after submitting the work in this manner. In order for a test to be re-graded, you must neatly state in writing the reason that you would like your test to be re-graded. If a test is submitted for a re-grade, I have the right to re-grade the entire test-so keep it mind that it is possible to lose additional points. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you do not ask for a re-grade unless you have substantial reason to believe that I made a mistake when originally grading the test. All regrade requests should be done within one week after the semester is finished. 

**Office Hours:** Please respect the office hours of the instructor by planning ahead. Other times are possible by appointments. 

**Final exam**: A form of digital proctoring might be used in the final exam. 

**Class participation points:**   Attending live lectures and office hours are strongly encouraged.  Hence, we are taking attendance for live lectures. Missing more than 1 lecture w/o dean of student's approval will cause losing partial participation points. However, if a student can actively participate in the piazza discussions, the students can also earn participation points. 

**Labday:** On lab days, you will complete a small task in the class. We will have two lab days with the same contents to provide better hands-on helping and also the limtied VM resource. There are small tasks that you have to submit after the lay days in addition to assignments. 

**Academic Integrity**

The course will follow all relevant and appropriate Georgia Institute of Technology academic regulations (http://www.honor.gatech.edu) including those about academic integrity. All students are expected to maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit for all work. Webster’s defines plagiarizing as “to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own: use (another's production) without crediting the source.” A student shall be guilty of a violation of academic integrity if he or she represents the work of others as his or her own or aids another's misrepresentation. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued according to the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code (https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code). Any violation associated with a homework, assignment, project, examination or quiz will result in a zero for the assignment, and the student will be subject to failure for the course. Such violations will be reported to the Office of Student Integrity (OSI), which may impose penalties beyond those by the instructor(s).

In this course, each student is expected to work independently on the first writing assignment; not working independently on the first two assignment will be considered a violation of the GT Academic Honor Code. Submitting any work other than your own, including a sentence without proper quotation marks with citation to the original source, is also a violation of the student honor code.

For any questions involving these or any other Academic Honor Code issues, please consult the professor(s) or www.honor.gatech.edu.” Students are also encouraged to read the ACM Code of Ethics (https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct), particularly sections 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2 and 2.4.

**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**

The course process will follow all relevant and appropriate Georgia Institute of Technology academic regulations including those relevant to students with disabilities. Any students requiring additional assistance due to disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities) should contact the professor(s) during the first week of the semester. Students requiring extra time for examinations and quizzes are asked to make arrangements at least three days in advance. You may contact the Office of Disability Services (http://www.adapts.gatech.edu) regarding campus services.

**Discrimination and Harassment**

Georgia Tech does not discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, or veteran status in the administration of admissions policies, educational policies, employment policies, or any other Institute-governed programs and activities. This class adheres to those guidelines. Alternative viewpoints are welcome in this classroom. However, statements that are deemed racist, sexist, classist, or otherwise discriminatory toward others in the class will not be tolerated.

No form of harassment or discrimination is allowed in this class. In keeping with the professional nature of this course, only professional behavior is acceptable between the instructor and the students and between students. No harassment of any kind is allowed in class including but not limited to gender, age, ability, religion, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.

**Statement of Intent for Classroom Inclusivity**

As members of the Georgia Tech community, we are committed to creating a learning environment in which all of our students feel safe and included. Because we are individuals with varying needs, we are reliant on your feedback to achieve this goal. To that end, we invite you to enter into dialogue with us about the things we can stop, start, and continue doing to make our classroom an environment in which every student feels valued and can engage actively in our learning community.
