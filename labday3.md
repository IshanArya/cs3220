Lab day #3  Assignments 

(Due : 2/17/21) **6pm EST**



In this assignment, you will use **assignment #3 frame**. Please look inside **assignment3_files folder**.

**The purpose of lab day #3 is to help you start on assignment # 3.** 

Before you start lab3, please watch labday3.mp4 video. 
assignment3_code_navigation.mp4 video is also provided to help you understand the assignment #3 code frame. 

step 1. create a project file and do run simulation.  

step 2. execute (synthesis, implementation)

step 3. based on your pipeline design, idetnify what signals need to be propgated. 
i.e.) what signals should be in from_de_to_fe from_wb_to_de etc. 


step 4. modify the stall signal in the front-end. 
PC will be increamented by instruction size every cycle 

step 5.look for the code that propogate PC values in each pipeline  
eg) PC_DE, PC_AGEX, PC_WB etc.  add all PC value in each pipeline latch in the wave form. 
run simulation (Behavior simulation) 


run simulation (Behavior simulation) and get a screenshopt. 
 
**What to submit**: a screenshot of simulation (**must be PNG or PDF**)

**Grading**: A screenshot that shows the PC value is incremented will be sufficient to get a full credit.
